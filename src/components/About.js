                        <p>I’m a college student looking to grow my software and web development experience . I study at Sullivan University and my major is cybersecurity. My programming journey kickstarted when I took an intro to programming class my first semester of college.<br></br> <br></br>
                        One hobby that I enjoy working on is game development. Two creations I have developed and designed are a path finding maze game and a rocket simulator which traverses though a variety of obstacles in a vibrant environment. But my largest project so far is a first-person shooter which takes place in a complex cyberpunk world filled with dangerous AIs. It has been a learning journey which has sharpened my skills in design, creativity, storytelling, and programming of course.<br></br> <br></br>
                        Besides coding, I enjoy hosting game nights for my friends, playing the guitar / piano, horseback riding and just getting out in nature!</p>
